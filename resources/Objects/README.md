# Objects

This folder is here for adding extra objects into the game along side the default ones.

To have a working model in game you must have done the following:

- Placed the object class in this folder (see How to make a object below).
- Placed the UVMap/design png in the `Designs` folder.
- Placed the geometry data in the `Designs` folder.
- Updated the `design_manifest` to include the data above.

**For more in depth info how to do this please see *this* guide.**
